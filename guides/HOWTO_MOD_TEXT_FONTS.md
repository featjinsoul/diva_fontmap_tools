How To Mod Main Text Fonts (Beginners Guide)
============================================

AFT, FT, and M39s fontmaps can be generated. Support for generating X and F2nd fontmaps is experimental.
The guide focuses on AFT, but most of it except for font numbers and IDs should work with the other games too.

Before starting, read through `selecting_fonts.md` to help with choosing a font to use.

1. Extract original fontmap  
   `python fontmap_extract.py fontmap.farc`  
   If you get an error about missing something, reinstall requirements.txt using pip (step 2 of installation).
2. Generate a bold font  
   See `generating_fonts.md` for info.  
   Use the charlist tool to generate a custom character list if not modding a Japanese or English FT series game.
3. Generate a regular font  
   **For AFT:** If you patch the game to have separate fontmaps, you can generate an entirely different font.  
   Without a patch, you should only use the same font as used for the bold one (but the non-bold version),
   and copy the sizing info from the generated bold font as explained in `generating_fonts.md`.
   (using two different fixed width fonts may also work well, but is untested)  
   **For other games:** I think they already use a separate fontmaps, but I don't know for sure.
4. Replace font JSON files  
   **For AFT:** The main font is `font9_24x24.json`, and the font inside has id `0`.
   Replace it with your generated bold fontmap, and set the id inside to `0` so it matches the original font.  
   If you patch the game to have separate fontmaps, copy your regular font to `font16.json` and set the id to `15`.
   **For other games:** Check `font_numbers.md` for known info (information may be incorrect)
5. Rebuild fontmap  
   `python fontmap_extract.py fontmap` (will turn folder contents into a farc)
6. Replace textures  
   Use the replace flipped option in MikuMikuModel. The fonts are in `spr_fnt_XX`.

### Troubleshooting
- If text is invisible, try reducing the font size until the texture shrinks.
- If the top or bottom of characters are cut off, try generating the font with `--force_baseline` set to about `0.85`.
- Test screens seem to have issues with proportional fonts, so don't worry if they look incorrect.
